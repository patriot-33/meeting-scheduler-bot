üõ°Ô∏è HOLISTIC PYTHON BACKEND DIAGNOSTIC & REPAIR SYSTEM v3.0

A comprehensive diagnostic and repair system that provides:
- Complete system analysis and dependency mapping
- Invariant detection and contract monitoring
- Multi-layer deep diagnostics
- Safe, incremental repair with rollback capability
- Continuous monitoring and validation
- Comprehensive change documentation and learning

This system follows the principle: "Every fix should make the system BETTER, not just different"

Usage:
    from diagnostic_system import HolisticDiagnosticSystem
    
    # Initialize the system
    diagnostic_system = HolisticDiagnosticSystem("/path/to/project")
    
    # Run complete diagnostics
    results = await diagnostic_system.diagnose_and_fix_safely("System is slow")
    
    # Get health report
    health = diagnostic_system.get_system_health()

üõ°Ô∏è HOLISTIC DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM - QUICK START GUIDE

1. BASIC USAGE:
   ```python
   from diagnostic_system import HolisticDiagnosticSystem
   
   # Initialize
   system = HolisticDiagnosticSystem("/path/to/your/project")
   
   # Run diagnostics and repair
   result = await system.diagnose_and_fix_safely("Problem description")
   
   # Check system health
   health = system.get_system_health()
   ```

2. STEP-BY-STEP DIAGNOSTICS:
   ```python
   # Start monitoring
   await system.start_monitoring()
   
   # Run just diagnostics
   diagnosis = await system.run_diagnostics("Issue description")
   
   # Apply fixes manually
   fix_result = await system.apply_fix_safely(fix_plan)
   
   # Stop monitoring
   await system.stop_monitoring()
   ```

3. ADVANCED USAGE:
   ```python
   # Get system analysis
   analysis = system.system_analyzer.analyze_complete_system()
   
   # Detect invariants
   invariants = system.invariant_detector.detect_invariants()
   
   # Run specific diagnostic layer
   findings = await system.deep_diagnostics.surface_diagnostics(context)
   
   # Get learned patterns
   suggestions = system.documentation.suggest_solutions("problem")
   ```

4. SAFETY FEATURES:
   - All changes are atomic and reversible
   - Comprehensive preflight checks before any change
   - Real-time monitoring during operations
   - Complete documentation of all changes
   - Learning from past successes and failures

5. MONITORING:
   ```python
   # Add custom alert handler
   def handle_alert(alert):
       print(f"Alert: {alert.title}")
   
   system.continuous_validator.add_alert_handler(handle_alert)
   
   # Generate health report
   report = system.continuous_validator.generate_health_report()
   ```

Remember: This system is designed to make your system BETTER and more reliable,
not just fix immediate problems. Every operation contributes to the system's
long-term health and maintainability.
